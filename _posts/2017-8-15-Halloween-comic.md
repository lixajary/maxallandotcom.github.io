I have been trying to give meditation a chance. I have tried it in the past with good results. I tried because I was really depressed and I needed something to help me but as soon as I felt better I stop doing it.
I have been researching about comedy and humor and I have found that some celebrities does this thing called transcendental meditation. They say that this can give you more energy to work on your projects and also that it boosts your creativity.  So why not to try it?  Yesterday I meditated for 13 minutes in the morning, I think I achieved some peace. This morning I tried for 10 min with not big results.
What I noticed about meditation is that you have to give to your mind the task to observe the breath all the time. When your lungs fill and when they empty. I like to exhale just a little bit more than my normal respiration so I can notice my breath. At some point I felt lighter and I think it was because I had no more thoughts at least for that moment.
I'm working on a collaborative mini comic halloween themed I'll publish it on any of my accounts as soon as it's ready.
